-	Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished.
-	Making HTTP requests using fetch()
-	Accessing a user's camera or microphone using getUserMedia()
-	Asking a user to select files using showOpenFilePicker()
-	This is the basic problem with long-running synchronous functions. What we need is a way for our program to:
    1.	Start a long-running operation by calling a function.
    2.	Have that function start the operation and return immediately, so that our program can still be responsive to other events.
    3.	Notify us with the result of the operation when it eventually completes.
-	Using synchronous functions, if it takes a long time, you cannot do anything else on the page until it finishes running.

-	Asynchronous functions work like event handlers. An event handler is a type of callback.
-	Nested callbacks (calling callbacks inside callbacks)= callback hell aka pyramid of doom, donâ€™t do this
